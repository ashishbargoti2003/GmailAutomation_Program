Respected sir/ma'am,


I hope you're doing well. I am reaching out from IIIT Delhi to extend a warm invitation to {} to be a part of our Entrepreneurship Summit (E-summit 2024) on March 15-16.


Last yearâ€™s summit was a remarkable success, featuring personalities like Ashneer Grover and Triggered Insaan. We're upping our game this year with over 25 diverse events, expecting a footfall of over 25,000. We hope to create a network of emerging entrepreneurs, investors, innovators, and leaders who can work together to make a difference.


This is a chance to engage with a diverse and influential crowd that only a select few will have.


IIITD is renowned for its 4-star rating in the Institute Innovation Council and a vibrant cultural scene. We've hosted industry giants like Sam Altman of OpenAI and celebrated performers such as Salim-Sulaiman, Shankar Mahadevan, and Bhuvan Bam.


Our alumni include YouTube sensation Triggered Insaan (17.7M subscribers), Shark Tank India-featured startups like Scrap Uncle and Tweek Labs, and social media influencers such as Harman Singh (400k+ followers across platforms).


We believe a partnership with your esteemed organization, {}, would be mutually beneficial, enhancing your visibility among a dynamic and influential audience. 


We're excited to explore partnership possibilities with {}. Our attached proposal outlines how we can collaborate to make E-Summit 2024 a landmark event in India's entrepreneurial landscape. Don't miss out on this unique opportunity to be at the forefront of innovation and networking.


Looking forward to a potential collaboration.


Warm regards,
